# code-everything
A simple app to code and run some javascript on the iPad.

Currently you need a laptop to create your own mobile app. Kidss may want to learn programming and would like to try to do their own apps, but may have no laptop to be able to do it. Most professional development IDE are very strong these days, but too complex for kids learning programming (maybe).
I remember when I learned programming with Turbo Pascal on DOS. What I really liked was the easy access to some code and be able just to click a run item in the menu and see my code working (or not).

Wouldn't it be cool to have the same experience on an iPad?

I know there are online tools, but most feels more like a playground.
